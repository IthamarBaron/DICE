# Discord Integrated Cryptographic Engine

Dice is used to store large files over discord servers safely for later usage. 
allowing you to save valuble storage space and save your files for free.


## Requirements

`Python`
`Discord Server`
`Discord Bot`
`LAN`




## How To Run

    1. Make sure to set the Token variable to your bot Token.
    2. Run `Server`.
    3. Run `ClientUI`.
    4. Enter the ip you want to connect to (defaults to local host 127.0.0.1).
    5. Log in / sign up as instructed.
    6. Select your file.
    7. Upload your selected file.
    8. Let DICE do its magic :)




## Features

- Easy File Upload 
- Easy File Download
- Encrypted communications
- Encrypted File Data 
- Multi Client Support

| This app was built as a school project and therefore needed to meet some criteria. (for example, database, encryption and multi client support) there is no doubt that there is absolutely no need for most of the features here, the app could just be the Discord bot with some UI.

**In The Future**
I might create a simpler version that is helpful and simple to use.


## Appendix

It is important for me to note that this project was built entirely for educational purposes and was used as my 12th-grade final project.
In no way do I encourage stealing storage space from Discord or any other platform.
